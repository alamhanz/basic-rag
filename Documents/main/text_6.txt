On 1 January 2024, at 16:10 JST (07:10 UTC), a MJMA7.6 (Mw7.5) earthquake
struck 7 km (4.3 mi) north-northwest of Suzu, located on the Noto Peninsula of
Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.[3] The reverse-faulting shock achieved a maximum
JMA seismic intensity of _Shindo 7_ and Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (
_Violent_ ). The shaking and accompanying tsunami caused extensive damage on
the Noto Peninsula, particularly in the towns of Wajima, Suzu and Anamizu. All
of the 220 fatalities and 26 missing individuals were reported in Ishikawa
while over 1,000 were injured across multiple prefectures, making it the
deadliest earthquake in Japan since the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.[4]

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) officially named this earthquake the
**2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake** (Japanese: 令和6年能登半島地震, Hepburn: _Reiwa
6-nen Noto-hantō Jishin_).[5] It led to Japan's first major tsunami warning
since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake,[6] and a tsunami of 6.58 m (22 ft) was
measured along the Sea of Japan coast.[7]

## Tectonic setting[edit]

Main article: Eastern margin of the Sea of Japan

The Noto Peninsula lies on the southeastern margin of the Sea of Japan, which
was formed by back-arc rifting related to subduction of the Pacific Plate
beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Japan Trench. This process began during
the Early Miocene, ending in the Middle Miocene. By the late Pliocene the
tectonic regime changed to compression, probably associated with collision
between the Izu–Bonin Arc and Honshu.[8] This led to reactivation of the rift
faults in reverse sense, combined with inversion of the basins formed by these
faults.[9] Currently Japan is situated on the convergent boundaries between
the Pacific, Philippine Sea, Okhotsk and Amurian Plates. Along the island
arc's east and southeast coasts, subduction of the Pacific and Philippine Sea
Plates occurs at the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough, respectively. The west
coast of Honshu, bordering the Sea of Japan, is a north–south trending
convergent boundary between the Amurian and Okhotsk Plates. It has been
proposed that it is an incipient subduction zone, consisting of eastward-
dipping thrust faults.[10]

The rifting and subsequent inversion has created a series of faults along the
coast that have the potential to move and cause earthquakes, in the range of
Mw 6.8–7.9, in many cases with tsunamis.[11] Major earthquakes and tsunamis
along this boundary occurred in 1741, 1833, 1940, 1964, 1983 and 1993,
although the origin of the 1741 tsunami remains open to debate.[12] A fault
known as the F43 (in the list of 60 faults evaluated) reaches the seabed just
north of the Noto peninsula trending WSW–ENE. This southeast-dipping fault,
which consists of two segments with a combined length of 94.2 km (58.5 mi),
has been judged to be capable of producing an earthquake of Mw 7.6.[11]

The northeastern tip of the Noto Peninsula has been subject to an earthquake
swarm for the last three years, with the largest earthquake being a Mw 6.3
event that took place in May 2023.[13] The earthquake was the strongest to hit
the peninsula since records began in 1885.[14]

## Earthquake[edit]

USGS ShakeMap

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a moment magnitude of 7.5
and a focal depth of 10 km (6.2 mi) for the earthquake. The Japan
Meteorological Agency recorded a magnitude of MJMA 7.6.[15][16] It was the
largest earthquake to strike Ishikawa since at least 1885,[17] and the largest
to strike Mainland Japan since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.[18]

The focal mechanism of the mainshock corresponded to shallow reverse faulting
along a northeast-trending plane dipping northwest or southeast,[3] happening
along the convergent boundary between the Okhotsk Plate and Amurian Plate. A
magnitude 5.5 foreshock struck four minutes before the mainshock,[19][20]
while a magnitude 6.2 aftershock struck nine minutes later.[21] More than
1,200 aftershocks were recorded across a 100 km (62 mi) zone.[22] At least
seven of them registered a magnitude of 5.0 and above.[7]

USGS generated Finite Fault Surface Projection

According to a finite fault model released by the USGS, the earthquake rupture
extended over 160 km (99 mi) by 20 km (12 mi) from the southwestern Noto
Peninsula to Sado Island along a southeast-dipping fault. Slip was mostly
concentrated entirely beneath the peninsula. The zones of the largest slip
occurred southwest of the hypocenter while little to no slip occurred in the
sea between the peninsula and island. The patch immediately southwest of the
epicenter produced the displacement of 5.992 m (20 ft) beneath the peninsula's
coast. Another zone of slip occurred further southwest beneath the same
stretch of coastline, producing up to 6.030 m (20 ft) of slip beneath
Motoichi. The fault likely ruptured towards the seafloor at the peninsula
while little to no slip was observed on the seafloor between the peninsula and
Sado Island. The entire rupture process took about 50 seconds with the
greatest phase of seismic moment release occurring some 25 seconds after
initiation.[23]

### Ground effects[edit]

About 85 km (53 mi) of coastline spanning Suzu, Wajima and Shika was raised
and the shore moved seawards by up to 200 m (660 ft). Wajima's Minazuki Bay
was uplifted 4 m (13 ft) while at Nagahashimachi's fishing port, a tide gauge
was rendered unuseable because the seafloor was exposed.[24] The Geospatial
Information Authority of Japan said parts of the country moved up to 1.3 m (4
ft 3 in) westwards with the maximum displacement observed at Wajima due to
crustal deformation. At Anamizu, land shifted 1 m (3 ft 3 in) westwards.
However, the agency said these movements could be slope or local ground
movement instead.[25] The agency also added that crustal uplift of 4 m (13 ft)
occurred in western Wajima and 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) in northern Suzu.[26] Near
Wajima's port, the shoreline of a sandy beach was moved 250 m (820 ft)
seawards due to the coastal uplift.[27] The coastline in the Kawaura district
of Suzu was also found to have moved 175 m (574 ft) seawards due to the
coastal uplift, while the land area expanded by a total of 2.4 square
kilometers. A port in the Ozawa district of Wajima was entirely drained.[28] A
seaward movement of 240 m (790 ft) was detected in the coasts of Monzenmachi
and Kuroshimamachi districts in Wajima, as well as an expansion of 4.4 square
kilometers in the Noto Peninsula. Areas in the northern part of the peninsula
were also found to have risen while the southern sections, particularly in
Anamizu, had subsided.[29]

### Intensity[edit]

The Japan Meteorological Agency said it recorded a maximum seismic intensity
of 7 ( _Shindo 7_ ), the highest level on its seismic intensity scale,[30] the
first time that an earthquake of that intensity had been observed in the
country since 2018.[31][32] The maximum intensity was reported in Shika,
Ishikawa Prefecture. Intensity 6+ was recorded in Nanao, Wajima, Suzu and
Anamizu. Intensity 6– was recorded in Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture and in
Ishikawa's Nakanoto and Noto.[32] The earthquake was also felt by residents in
Tokyo and across the Kanto Region[7] and as far as Aomori Prefecture in the
northern tip of Honshu to Kyushu in the south of the country.[31] A peak
ground acceleration of 2,826 _gal_ was observed in Shika, which was close to
that recorded during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake which measured 2,934
_gal_.[33] Due to the ground beneath Wajima and Anamizu comprising soft
sediments, ground motions were amplified.[34]

## Tsunami[edit]

### Japan[edit]

Map of Tsunami Warnings issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency at 1 January
2024 16:22 JST

Large parts of Japan's western coast, from Hokkaido to Nagasaki Prefectures
were immediately placed under a tsunami warning after the earthquake struck,
with evacuation orders issued in Ishikawa, Niigata, Toyama, and Yamagata
prefectures. The earthquake triggered a major tsunami warning, the first one
since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Public broadcaster NHK said tsunami waves of
5 m (16 ft) could be expected.[7] The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said
dangerous tsunami waves were possible within 300 km (190 mi) of the
epicenter.[65]

The evacuation orders covered 62,000 people,[66] with 1,000 evacuees finding
shelter at the Japan Air Self-Defense Force base in Wajima in Ishikawa
Prefecture.[67] The major tsunami warning was later downgraded to a tsunami
warning at 20:30, about four hours after the earthquake.[68] These tsunami
warnings were later downgraded to advisories,[69] which were eventually lifted
at 10:01 on 2 January, about 18 hours after the earthquake.[70]

The first waves were reported to have arrived at around 16:21,[7] although a
team of researchers from Tohoku University's International Research Institute
of Disaster Science said the first waves reached the Noto Peninsula within a
minute of the earthquake. In Suzu, the first waves were estimated to arrive
one minute after the shock and two minutes later at Nanao. They also estimated
Toyama was struck by the waves in about five minutes.[71] The quicker-than-
anticipated tsunami arrival meant people did not evacuate in time. Fumihiko
Imamura, a member of the research team, said it may have been due to the close
proximity of the fault to the coast or a possible submarine landslide in
Toyama Bay. Tsunamis in the Sea of Japan have been observed to arrive faster
than those along Japan's Pacific coast.[72] Tsunami modelling executed by the
University of Tokyo and Building Research Institute of Japan computed the
tsunami to be 3.6 m (12 ft) in Suzu; 3 m (9.8 ft) in Noto; 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in)
in Shika and 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in Jōetsu, Niigata.[73]

Flooding by the tsunami exceeded 4 m (13 ft) along the east and western part
of the peninsula. In Suzu, the highest waves exceeded 4.7 m (15 ft) at Misaka
Town, destroying homes and damaging the seawall. At Shika's Kagami area, the
tsunami was recorded at 5.1 m (17 ft).[74] A run-up of about 4.2 m (14 ft) was
estimated at Shika based on the survey of warehouses and port facilities.[75]
Aerial photographs of Suzu suggested a wave height of 3 m (9.8 ft) above sea
level;[76] subsequent analysis indicated a wave of 4.5 m (15 ft) at Nanba,
Misakimachi.[77] Tsunami waves exceeding 1.2 m (4 ft) struck Wajima,[78]
however data from the tide gauge was incomplete as it was one of several tide
gauges across the peninsula that stopped receiving information shortly
after.[79] A tide gauge at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant recorded a rise of 3
m (9.8 ft) in tide level at between 17:45 and 18:00.[80] The plant's operator
later said that a 3 m (9.8 ft) wave reached the facility, which was built at
an elevation of 11 m (36 ft) above sea level and had a seawall measuring 4 m
(13 ft) high, at 17:45, without causing damage.[81]

A tsunami measuring 90 cm (35 in) struck Kanazawa,[82] while a tsunami of 80
cm (31 in) struck Toyama Prefecture and Sakata, Yamagata Prefecture.[83] Waves
measuring 50 cm (20 in) were recorded in Nanao and Tsuruga[82] while waves
measuring 40 cm (16 in) were recorded at Kashiwazaki,[84] Tobishima, and Sado
Island.[83] In Toyama city, a 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) wave was reported.[78] The
tsunami was recorded in Tottori Prefecture with heights of 0.6 m (2 ft 0 in)
in Sakaiminato and 0.2 m (7.9 in) in Iwami; in Toyooka, Hyogo Prefecture, it
reached 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in).[85] A 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in) tsunami was recorded at the
port area of Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture.[86] In Hokkaido, waves of up to 60 cm
(24 in) were reported in Setana, while 50 cm (20 in) waves struck Okushiri
Island.[83]

The highest tsunami wave reached 6.58 m (21.6 ft) at a public park 600 m
(2,000 ft) from the Seki River mouth. The tsunami swept people away at the
entrance of a building and in the park. The locally high waves may be
attributed to the seafloor bathymetry concentrating the tsunami at a specific
location.[87] Video footage in Jōetsu, Niigata showed the tsunami approaching
the rivermouth at 16:35, crashing into embankments and causing seawater to
overflow.[88] Evidence appeared to show that the tsunami reached at least 5.5
km (3.4 mi) upstream from the river mouth.[89]

### Damage[edit]

In Suzu, the tsunami was said to have arrived a minute following the
earthquake.[90] Homes were washed off their foundations and some were driven
further inland.[91] At least one person was killed by the tsunami.[92] The
earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the town's
buildings.[93] The tsunami capsized many fishing vessels and carried some onto
land. Building collapses and overturned cars were observed from a news
helicopter flyover of the city.[94] A resident recalled tsunami waves washing
over a road, picking up cars and debris; he also estimated the waves were 3 m
(9.8 ft) above tide level.[95] Ishikawa Prefecture's governor, Hiroshi Hase,
said the tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to 100 m (330 ft)
inland.[96] A study conducted by Professor Shunichi Koshimura of Tohoku
University found that the damage in Suzu was exacerbated by the seabed terrain
of Toyama Bay.[34]

In Shika, a series of tsunami waves reached the port at 17:40.[97] The tsunami
which had a 4.2 m (14 ft) run-up damaged the city's fishing port and its
facilities.[75] Tsunami observations in the peninsula was made difficult by
the coastal uplift raising parts of the coast by up to 4.1 m (13 ft) and
extending the coastline further seawards.[98]

In the Shiromaru area of Noto, Ishikawa, homes were washed away and a fire was
started.[99] In Jōetsu, Niigata, the locally-high run-up exceeding 6 m (20 ft)
flooded 15 homes along the Seki River bank.[100] Beach houses and other
buildings were also swept away.[101] Ten fishing vessels capsized in the Ogata
Fishing Port area. Containers were also washed away and warehouses storing
machinery were flooded.[102] The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism assessed that the tsunami inundated at least 100 ha (250 acres) of
land in Suzu and Noto.[103] At least 120 maritime vessels were reported to
have been sunk or capsized from the tsunami, while at least 70 percent of
ports in Ishikawa Prefecture sustained damage.[104]

### Elsewhere along the Sea of Japan[edit]

The Korea Meteorological Administration warned that the coastlines of Gangwon
Province and Pohang in South Korea could experience a rise in sea
levels.[105][84] Waves of 0.3 m (1 ft) were anticipated along the nation's
east coast from 18:29 to 19:17 local time.[106] A 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) tsunami
was later reported to have occurred in Gangwon.[83][107] A 0.85 m (3 ft) high
wave reportedly struck Mukho at around 20:00 local time.[108] Tsunamis with
heights of 0.66 m (2 ft 2 in) were recorded in Uljin; 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) in
Sokcho and 0.39 m (1 ft 3 in) in Gangneung.[109] It is thought to be the first
tsunami of over 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) observed in the country since 1993.[110]
According to Yonhap News Agency, citing North Korean state radio, a tsunami
warning was issued with waves of 2.08 m (6 ft 10 in) potentially hitting the
country's east coast.[107][111]

Warnings for tsunami waves estimated to reach 1 m (3 ft) were also issued in
Russia, particularly along the west coast of Sakhalin Island,[112] where
evacuations were said to be conducted,[113] although Russia later said that no
evacuations were taking place there.[114] Tsunami warnings were also declared
in parts of Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsk Krai,[115] Vladivostok and
Nakhodka.[116] The Emergencies Ministry of Russia said "response teams are
ready to deal with the possible consequences of a tsunami."[117] Officials in
Vladivostok later said "no tsunami was observed" while in Nakhodka, "the
tsunami passed almost unnoticed."[118] A 0.63 m (2 ft 1 in) wave was observed
at Preobrazhenie in Primorsky Krai;[119] at Kholmsk, it measured 0.18 m (7.1
in).[120]

## Damage and effects[edit]

destroyed by the subsequent fires

The earthquake struck as Japan was marking New Year's Day, a public holiday
when many were at home and most establishments were closed.[121] At least 220
deaths occurred in Ishikawa Prefecture; 98 in Suzu, 88 in Wajima, 20 in
Anamizu, six in Noto, five in Nanao, two in Shika and one in Hakui.[122]
Thirteen people died in the aftermath due to injuries or illnesses.[123]
Additionally, one person was killed by the tsunami.[92] At least 1,009 people
were severely injured in the prefecture,[124] and as of 12 January[update], 26
people remained missing,[122] some of which may have been swept into the sea
by the tsunami.[125]

By 3 January, about 31,800 people were living in shelters following the
earthquake,[126] with about 27,700 sheltering in 336 evacuation centers in
Ishikawa prefecture alone.[127]

Damage was especially severe in Wajima, Suzu and Noto although their extent
was unclear.[128] At least 780 people across 30 districts in remote vilages
were isolated due to damaged roads and landslides and required helicopters to
be reached.[129] Many of the collapsed houses in Wajima were traditional
wooden structures that were built prior to current building regulations that
were imposed in 1981. Information from 2018 also revealed that more than half
of buildings in Wajima did not follow these regulations.[130] In Suzu, many
buildings were built before the enactment of modern building codes in 1950,
while in 2019, only 51% of the town's houses were deemed earthquake-resistant,
compared with 87% for the entire country.[131]

At least 11,297 buildings across Ishikawa were damaged.[122] Many homes in
Wajima, Suzu, and Noto were destroyed but the number remains unspecified.[132]
In Wajima, at least 60 houses collapsed,[133][134] and ninety percent of the
fatalities there were attributed to falling debris from collapsed houses.[135]
A fire occurred in the city around 17:00. Due to damaged roads, firefighters
were unable to extinguish the flames.[136] The fire consumed an estimated 200
buildings, including many homes,[137][138] and the Asaichi morning market; a
1,000-year old shopping district and tourist attraction that hosted about 200
stalls.[139] An area of up to 48,000 square metres was affected by the fire,
which experts said was exacerbated by the loss of water supply and the tsunami
warning, which prevented firefighters from responding immediately to the
blaze.[140] More than 30 people were injured in the city. In Suzu, up to 5,000
houses[141] and 90 percent of the buildings were destroyed,[142][143]
including many due to fires.[144] The mayor of Suzu said about 4,000 to 5,000
households of the city's 6,000 were no longer habitable, adding that damage
was "catastrophic".[145]

The Ishikawa Nanao Police Station said collapsed homes trapped people before
they were rescued.[146] A spokesperson at Wajima Municipal Hospital said
people had broken bones or were injured by falling objects.[147] Seventeen
buildings collapsed, 24 were partly destroyed and 19 were partially damaged in
Shika.[128] In Anamizu, nine buildings were destroyed,[148] including three by
a landslide which killed 16 people.[149] Across the mountainous region of the
peninsula, landslides were widespread.[91] The number of landslides was
estimated at 1,000.[150] At least nine landslide dams were discovered in the
Wajima area on 9 January. These landslide dams had the potential to cause
debris avalanches.[151]

Twenty homes in Shiromaru, Noto, were destroyed by fire, while many others
collapsed.[128] The tsunami also washed debris onto streets.[152] Operations
of the Noto Airport were suspended after five cracks as long as 10 m (33 ft)
appeared on the runway; the terminal of the airport also sustained
damage.[153] Access roads leading to the airport were blocked, while about 500
passengers were left stranded inside the facility,[66] which was expected to
be closed until 4 January. Access to the northern part of the Noto Peninsula
was limited by a damaged road.[127] Noto Island was isolated after the bridge
linking it to Nanao in Honshu was closed.[121] At least 902 houses in Uchinada
and 698 others in Kahoku were damaged.[92]

In Toyama Prefecture, 41 people were injured, three of them seriously.[154]
Eight of the injuries occurred after the ceiling of a pachinko parlor
collapsed in Toyama City.[155] Twenty-two houses collapsed, 20 others were
severely damaged and 1,873 others were partially damaged, mostly in the cities
of Himi and Toyama.[154] In Niigata Prefecture, 48 people were injured, 11
buildings collapsed or were badly affected and 4,955 others were partially
damaged, including 3,930 in Niigata City;[156][157] 44 areas of Nishi Ward had
liquefaction reported.[132] One cardiac arrest case was reported in an elderly
person in the prefecture, likely linked to the earthquake.[158] In Fukui
Prefecture, six people sustained minor injuries,[148] and 45 houses sustained
minor damage in Awara.[159] Two injuries were also reported each in Osaka[160]
and Hyōgo Prefectures,[161] while one person each was injured in Gifu and
Nagano prefectures;[132] in Nagano, four houses were partially damaged.[162]

Cracked roads and broken water mains were reported in the cities of Himi and
Oyabe, Toyama Prefecture.[163] Liquefaction occurred in Niigata city; sewer
pipes also ruptured and many homes were left without water.[164] Thirty homes,
mostly in Nishi-ku, were damaged.[165] The Onohiyoshi Shrine in Kanazawa also
sustained damage. A landslide struck the main expressway between Toyama and
Kanazawa, ripping apart several hundred meters of roadway.[166] Four houses
along a hill fell over as the land under them collapsed in the eastern part of
Kanazawa.[167] Sections of Japan National Route 8 was buried by landslides in
Jōetsu, while track foundations caved in at the JR Echigo Line.[168] A bridge
along the Kurobe Gorge Railway, a popular tourist line, was damaged due to
falling rocks.[169] Cracks also appeared at the Nōetsu Expressway.[170]

Around 260 convenience stores in the affected areas belonging to 7-11 and
Family Mart were closed, while deliveries were delayed due to road
closures.[121] Japan Post also suspended services to the Noto Peninsula until
12 January due to road closures.[171] NTT Docomo, Rakuten Mobile,[83] Softbank
and KDDI reported telecommunications and internet service disruptions in
Ishikawa and Niigata prefectures,[172] while NTT West said its facilities were
damaged by the earthquake. At Shika Nuclear Power Plant, an explosion occurred
near the power transformer of the No. 2 reactor, while the transformer at the
No. 1 reactor was rendered inoperable due to an oil spill.[83][173] The site's
4 m (13 ft) high seawall was found to have tilted by around several
centimeters following the earthquake.[174] At the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear
Power Plant in Niigata prefecture, water spilled from the fuel pools of two
reactors due to the force of the earthquake.[175]

At least 36,000 households and 19 medical facilities lost power following the
earthquake[84][121] and more than 110,000 households were left without
water.[176] In Shika, water was being rationed daily at six litres per person
following the earthquake.[177] By the morning of 3 January, the number of
households without power had dropped to approximately 33,900.[178]

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology reported
that 276 educational facilities had been damaged by the earthquake,
particularly in Niigata, Ishikawa, Toyama, Fukui and Shiga prefectures. It
also said 39 schools in four prefectures had been converted to evacuation
shelters. The ministry also reported damage to 20 cultural sites in Toyama and
Niigata prefectures. Several stone lanterns collapsed at the Zuiryū-ji temple
in Takaoka, which is a designated National Treasure, while a slope collapsed
at the Sado mine.[179] About 350 people across evacuation centers were
infected by COVID-19 or the common flu,[180] while at least 40 cases of
gastrointestinal illnesses such as norovirus were detected.[181] A 90 year old
woman was rescued from a collapsed house after 124 hours in Suzu.[182]

## Response[edit]

### Government response[edit]

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the establishment of a special
emergency center to gather and disseminate information on the earthquake and
tsunami.[112] Defense minister Minoru Kihara ordered the Japan Self-Defense
Forces (JSDF) to assist in rescue efforts.[183] He later announced the
deployment of 2,000 JSDF personnel to the affected region,[184] with 8,500
others on standby. About 20 JSDF aircraft were also dispatched to survey the
damage.[185] An additional 2,000 firefighters and 1,000 police officers were
also deployed to assist in rescue operations.[176][186] About 3,000 rescuers
were sent to the Noto Peninsula alone.[187] By 4 January, at least 150 people
had been rescued, while at least 2,000 of the 10,000 evacuees from Wajima had
received humanitarian aid.[130]

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida led the government response to the earthquake.

The Japanese government announced that it would allocate 4 billion yen ($28
million) from reserve funds to use in disaster relief efforts[188] and
increased the number of JSDF personnel involved in the response to 6,300.
Defence Minister Kihara added that UH60JA helicopters were to be used in
relief efforts, in their first major deployment since the 2023 Miyakojima
helicopter crash in April.[189] The Japanese government also announced that
families whose houses were completely destroyed or severely damaged would
receive aid amounting to 3 million yen ($20,000).[190] Ishikawa, Niigata,
Toyama and Fukui prefectures requested financial support for 47 municipalities
under the Disaster Relief Act, under which the national government is expected
to cover 50 to 90 percent of expenses for disaster response and
rehabilitation. The Japanese health ministry also instructed hospitals to
offer health insurance coverage to patients affected by the quake, including
those without insurance certificates[191] and opened a telephone interpreting
service in 23 languages to help medical workers handle foreign patients in the
affected areas.[192] Authorities in Ishikawa prefecture also opened an email
help line to assist affected residents and tourists.[193]

On 4 January, the Japan Coast Guard began searching its coast with an aircraft
and patrol boat for people missing; presumably swept away by the tsunami.[125]
At least one person was declared missing from the tsunami.[194] At least two
people were rescued after the expiration of the 72-hour survival window in
Wajima on 4 January. Large holes in roads and landslides made rescue efforts
challenging four days after the earthquake.[195] Snowy weather conditions also
affected rescue efforts, with snowfall reaching 10 cm (3.9 in) in several
areas and raising concerns of additional building collapses.[196] Snowfall
significantly affected rescuers' ability to deliver supplies to isolated
villages and recover survivors. Power was also cut due to snow, disabling cell
phones.[197]

Following reports of deaths at evacuation centers, several vulnerable evacuees
were evacuated to other prefectures, with at least 30 people being transferred
to medical facilities in Aichi Prefecture.[198] The government said it had
secured about 6,500 public housing units for evacuees to resettle in across
the country.[181]

### Nuclear power plants[edit]

Kansai Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company and Hokuriku
Electric Power Company said they were inspecting their nuclear power plants
for abnormalities.[7][199][172] Both the Kansai[106] and Hokuriku Electric
Power Companies initially said no abnormalities were reported,[200] with the
reactors at the latter's Shika Nuclear Power Plant in Ishikawa Prefecture
having been closed for inspections at the time of the earthquake. However, it
was later confirmed that there had been a cumulative oil spillage of 19,800
liters at two of the reactors, partially impacting the plant's ability to
receive power from external sources.[201][202]

The Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) also found no irregularities
in power plants along the Sea of Japan coastline,[134] but ordered Hokuriku
Electric Power Company to conduct further study of the earthquake's impact on
the Shika Nuclear Power Plant.[203] Hokuriku Electric Power Company also shut
down two generators at its Nanao Ota thermal power plant in Nanao.[82]

### Transport[edit]

Shinkansen services were suspended in central and eastern parts of Japan
following the earthquake,[204] stranding at least 1,400 passengers aboard four
stalled trains between Toyama and Kanazawa for about 11 hours.[127][205][206]
Local train services were also halted for up to 24 hours following the
earthquake, stranding about 1,000 passengers aboard express trains.[66]
Shinkansen services resumed in the afternoon of 2 January.[207] Several major
highways in the affected areas were also closed.[208] All Nippon Airways and
Japan Airlines cancelled flights to Toyama, Ishikawa, and Niigata prefectures
for the rest of 1 January.[172] Japan Airlines subsequently announced
additional flights to Komatsu Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture and Niigata
Airport on 2 January.[209]

By the morning of 3 January, Japan Railways partially resumed services,[210]
however, some local lines remained suspended, including the Nanao Line and the
Noto Railway.[170] The MLIT confirmed that Noto Airport would remain closed
until 4 January,[210] with the resumption of services expected to resume on 25
January.[170]

### Humanitarian aid[edit]

Due to blocked roads, humanitarian aid was sent to the peninsula using ships,
while other isolated areas were accessed through helicopters.[211] In light of
the difficulties in providing aid, Ishikawa Prefecture asked individuals to
refrain from sending aid, instead limiting the call to corporations only.[212]
By 4 January, authorities had delivered about 240,000 meals, 500 packages of
powdered milk, and 190,000 bottles of drinking water to the affected
areas.[213]

On the evening of 2 January, a collision occurred at Haneda Airport in Tokyo
between a Japan Coast Guard DHC-8 aircraft carrying humanitarian aid to
earthquake victims in Niigata and Japan Airlines Flight 516, an A350-900 from
New Chitose Airport landing at Haneda, destroying both aircraft. All 379
people aboard the JAL plane were evacuated; however, 15 sustained
injuries.[214] The captain of the Coast Guard plane escaped with critical
injuries, while the remaining five crew members were killed.[215][216][217]

Private organizations raised at least $8 million in crowdfunding drives for
relief aid, while the Ishikawa prefectural government began accepting cash
donations at its offices, including those in Tokyo and Osaka, while announcing
plans to open a bank account for further donations.[218] Apparel companies,
including Gunze, Fast Retailing and Onward Holdings, donated at least 170,000
items for victims of the earthquake.[219] About 110 hotels and inns
volunteered to take in 3,000 people displaced by the earthquake.[220]

The Taiwanese government announced ¥60 million in aid to support rescue
operations and relief. A donation account was also created.[221] United States
Ambassador Rahm Emmanuel pledged an initial $100,000 in humanitarian aid to
Japan and logistical support from the United States military.[222] Japan said
it only had plans to accept aid from the United States despite offers from
other countries including Taiwan and China. In a statement from Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the country was "not accepting any personnel or
material aid at the moment given the situation on the ground and the efforts
that would be required to receive them."[223] South Korea also said that it
would provide $3 million worth of humanitarian aid.[224]

Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player Shohei Ohtani donated an undisclosed
amount of aid to victims in the Noto peninsula.[225] The Dodgers subsequently
announced that it would donate an additional $1 million towards earthquake
relief.[226]

JR Freight announced that it would carry humanitarian aid to the affected
areas for free.[227]

The construction of temporary housing began on 12 January with 115 home units
in Wajima and Suzu. Sixty units in Noto and Anamizu were also scheduled for
construction on 15 January.[228]

## Aftermath[edit]

The aftermath of the earthquake included a major humanitarian impact in the
worst affected regions, as well as a national economic impact. Preliminary
findings by Japanese financial services company Nomura Securities suggested
the temporary stagnation of economic activity would push down nominal GDP by
23 to 50 billion yen. Nomura estimated that the most affected cities, such as
Suzu, Wajima and Nanao, will experience a temporary pause in economic
activity. NHK added that losses are likely to increase, as the damage to
roads, housing and factories has not been considered in the research.[229]
However, it is estimated that the wider impact on supply chains may be less
than those compared to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.[230] Tourism in the
affected areas suffered negatively, with 10,000 people cancelling their
bookings in Toyama Prefecture alone, leading to losses of about 140 million
yen ($970,000 dollars).[169]

As of 5 January, approximately 24,000 buildings remained without electricity
in Ishikawa prefecture, and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry
(METI), Ken Saitō, told reporters of the difficulty of estimating a clear
timeframe for the recovery of power.[230] A whale shark at the Notojima
Aquarium died nine days after the earthquake. Park officials said damaged
equipment may have deteriorated living conditions inside the tank and
contributed to its death.[231]

## Reactions[edit]

### Domestic[edit]

Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako's annual New Year appearance and greetings
to the public on 2 January was cancelled due to the earthquake.[66] The
Imperial Household Agency said it was the first time that the event was
cancelled due to a natural disaster. It also reported that the Imperial couple
"wish that rescue operations and fire-fighting efforts in affected areas will
progress as quickly as possible amid the severe cold weather."[232] Prime
Minister Kishida also postponed a ceremonial New Year visit to the Ise Shrine
due to the earthquake.[175]

A moment of silence was held for the victims of the earthquake on the first
day of trading of 2024 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[233]

Toyota delayed the beginning of its domestic vehicle manufacturing operations
for 2024, which had been due to begin on 8 January, until further notice,
citing earthquake damage to some of its suppliers.[234]

### International[edit]

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister
Fumio Kishida, his condolences and wished the Japanese people a fast recovery.
It marked the first time Kim has sent his condolences after a natural
disaster, and the first time he has sent a telegram to Kishida.[235] It was
also the first time that North Korea had sent official condolences to Japan
since 1995.[236] Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent condolences
and said Australia was ready to send any assistance to
Japan.[121][237][238][239][240][241][235] Philippine president Bongbong Marcos
offered to send assistance to Japan,[239] while the Armed Forces of the
Philippines also offered to collaborate with the JSDF in its response to the
earthquake.[242][243] International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina
Georgieva and Pope Francis also expressed their prayers to the victims of the
earthquake.[121][244] The United States announced preparations for military
logistics, food and aid. United States Forces Japan it remained "ready to
support our Japanese Allies during this difficult time."[245]

In China, a news anchor from Hainan Radio and Television was suspended after
stating on his Weibo account that the earthquake was retribution over the
Japanese government's decision to discharge radioactive water from the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean which started in
September 2023.[246][247]

## Misinformation[edit]

Misinformation about the earthquake spread on social media platforms such as
Twitter.[248][249] Users falsely linked a November 2023 video of an underwater
earthquake in Indonesia,[250] photos of the 2011 Tōhoku and 2016 Kumamoto
earthquakes[251] and a 2021 landslide following the earthquake.[249] At least
one account, claiming to belong to a victim of the earthquake, was found to be
using misinformation to seek donations online.[252] False claims were also
made of the earthquake being man-made, with a video citing a previous nuclear
weapons test by North Korea.[248]

Former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatayama incorrectly claimed the
earthquake caused a fire at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant and suggested that
impacts of the earthquake had been deliberately downplayed to restart the
plant. While there had been a minimal oil spill at two of the reactors of the
plant, it was confirmed that there was no impact on the plant.[253]
