More\\nquakes are expected to come this week.\\n\\nJapan is particularly prone to earthquakes because four of the earth’s\\ntectonic plates meet in the country. Japan experienced a devastating quake in\\n2011 with a death toll of nearly 20,000 people, with most killed by tsunami\\nwaves, and also caused nuclear plant meltdowns in Fukushima. The disaster is\\nbelieved to have caused $220bn worth of damage.\\n\\n## Keep reading\\n\\nlist of 3 itemslist 1 of 3\\n\\n### Powerful earthquake strikes Japan, residents flee some coastal areas\\n\\nlist 2 of 3\\n\\n### Photos: Powerful earthquake hits Japan, residents flee some coastal areas\\n\\nlist 3 of 3\\n\\n### Japan lifts tsunami warnings but warns earthquake damage ‘widespread’\\n\\nend of list\\n\\nHere is what you need to know about Monday’s earthquake.\\n\\n## Where and when did the earthquake occur?\\n\\n  * Quakes began at around 4pm local time (07:00 GMT) on Monday. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake was reported near the Noto Peninsula in Japan’s Ishikawa prefecture. Japan is divided into 47 prefectures which are types of administrative divisions. Earthquakes measuring between 7.0 to 7.9 are considered “major” and can cause serious damage. The largest earthquake ever recorded was magnitude 9.6 in Chile in 1960.\\n  * The earthquake generated ocean waves about 1 metre (3 feet) high along Japan’s west coast and on the coast of neighbouring South Korea. The temblor was also felt in Japan’s capital, Tokyo, 300km (186 miles) away on the other side of the country.\\n  * Across nine prefectures, almost 100,000 people were evacuated and spent the night in sports halls and school gymnasiums, commonly used as evacuation centres in emergencies in Japan. These are often built with an accompanying “disaster storehouse” which contains food supplies and other essentials to support living for a period of time.\\n  * The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued low-level tsunami warnings for the prefectures of Niigata and Toyama and a major tsunami warning for Ishikawa that was lifted on Tuesday morning.\\n  * Within two hours of the major earthquake near the Noto Peninsula, the Japanese public broadcaster, NHK TV, had urged people to flee to higher ground or to get to the top of nearby buildings as quickly as possible. It was feared that floodwaters could reach as high as 5 metres (16.4 feet) in the event of a tsunami.\\n  * A tsunami wave around 1.2 metres (4 feet) high hit Wajima city in Ishikawa 10 minutes after the magnitude 7.6 quake occurred, while a fire sparked by the collapse of buildings engulfed houses in the area. Residents were forced to evacuate in the dark because of power outages. People were seen carrying belongings such as blankets, while others rushed out holding babies.\\n  * On Tuesday, JMA reported that the country had been hit by 155 earthquakes since the initial tremor on Monday.\\n\\n## Is this region particularly prone to earthquakes?\\n\\nJapan is one of the countries in the world most at risk from earthquakes.\\nSeismic activity has been simmering in the area for some time. Between\\nDecember 2020 and last month, 506 quakes with an intensity of at least 1.0\\nwere recorded. Experts say they will not know why this more major series of\\nearthquakes was not anticipated until further research has been carried out.\\n\\nIshikawa, a popular tourist destination famous for its cultural heritage\\nsites, lies near the tectonic plate boundary between the earth’s Eurasian and\\nNorth American plates. Such areas are particularly susceptible to earthquakes\\nbecause of the movement of the plates against each other, and the stronger\\nshock this causes in nearby areas.\\n\\nMonday’s earthquake is the strongest to have occurred in Ishikawa since 1885\\nwhen data first became available.\\n\\nMonday also marks the country’s first major tsunami warning since March 2011\\nwhen a magnitude 9.0 earthquake in the Tohoku region killed more than 18,000\\npeople and triggered nuclear plant meltdowns in Fukushima.\\n\\n## How many casualties have there been so far?\\n\\nAt least 30 people have been killed in Ishikawa and rescue teams are still\\ntrying to reach areas where people are feared to have been trapped under\\ncollapsed buildings. At least 14 people have been critically injured.\\n\\n“The government has identified at least six to 10 people trapped inside\\nbuildings and [the total] may be much higher than that, considering the\\ngovernment is usually quite conservative about these numbers until their\\nofficial [final tally],” said Al Jazeera correspondent Chris Gilbert,\\nreporting from Tokyo.\\n\\n## Will there be more quakes?\\n\\nJMA has warned that further quakes with a seismic intensity of 7.0 could hit\\nthe region over the next week, particularly in the next two to three days.\\nThere is a heightened risk of fires and landslides, the JMA said. Officials\\nwarned residents of some areas to stay away from their homes because of the\\npotential danger.\\n\\nThe warning of a major tsunami for Ishikawa, however, was cut to an advisory-\\nonly alert and eventually lifted on Tuesday morning. A tsunami “advisory”\\nindicates that significant flooding is not expected but local officials may\\ntake some action such as closing beaches or evacuating harbours.\\n\\n“The tsunami threat has now largely passed,” the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami\\nWarning Center said on Monday night.\\n\\n## How much damage has the earthquake caused?\\n\\nThe Japanese authorities are still assessing the extent of the damage but the\\nquake has so far resulted in several deaths, collapsed buildings, fires in\\nWajima and power outages across Ishikawa.\\n\\nAlmost 33,000 households remained without power in Ishikawa prefecture early\\non Tuesday morning in Japan, according to information on Hokuriku Electric\\nPower’s website. Broadcaster NHK said most areas in the northern Noto\\nPeninsula were also without water.\\n\\nSeveral highways near the epicentre were closed, while flights and bullet\\ntrain services to the area had also been suspended.\\n\\nIn Suzu, a coastal town of just over 5,000 households near the quake’s\\nepicentre, there may have been as many as 1,000 houses destroyed, according to\\nits mayor, Masuhiro Izumiya.\\n\\n## How quickly will people trapped under rubble be rescued?\\n\\nWith warnings of further quakes to come, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned\\nlate on Monday that efforts to rescue people trapped under collapsed buildings\\nwould be a “race against time”.\\n\\nThousands of army personnel, firefighters and police officers from across the\\ncountry have been dispatched to the worst-hit areas of the Noto Peninsula in\\nthe Ishikawa prefecture.\\n\\nSo far, rescuers have been struggling to reach the northern tip of the\\npeninsula because of the damaged state of the roads, while helicopter surveys\\nhave identified a large number of fires and widespread damage to buildings and\\ninfrastructure.\\n\\n## Which nearby countries are at risk?\\n\\nRussia, North and South Korea and the neighbouring island of Sakhalin have\\nalso issued tsunami warnings.\\n\\nRussia issued tsunami warnings for its far eastern cities, Vladivostok and\\nNakhodka. Local authorities in Vladivostok ordered fishermen to “urgently get\\nback to shore”.\\n\\nA tsunami wave measuring 0.67 metres (2.2 feet) high reached South Korea’s\\neast coast of Mukho in Gangwon province on Monday night, the country’s\\nmeteorological agency said. Authorities in Gangwon and Samcheok city warned\\nresidents to evacuate to higher ground.\\n\\nNorth Korea issued warnings of tsunami waves of up to 2.08 metres (6.8 feet)\\nfor its east coast.\\n\\nAdditionally, an emergency services alert on Sakhalin island near Japan said\\nits western coast “may be affected by tsunami waves”.\\n\\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n###\\n\\n##\\n\\n##\\n\\n##\\n\\naj-logo\\n\\n###\\n\\n##\\n\\n##\\n\\n##\\n\\naj-logo\\n\\n###\\n\\n##\\n\\n##\\n\\n##\\n\\naj-logo\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  * AboutShow more\\n\\n    * About Us\\n    * Code of Ethics\\n    * Terms and Conditions\\n    * EU/EEA Regulatory Notice\\n    * Privacy Policy\\n    * Cookie Policy\\n    * Cookie Preferences\\n    * Sitemap\\n    * Work for us\\n    * HR Quality\\n\\n  * ConnectShow more\\n\\n    * Contact Us\\n    * User Accounts Help\\n    * Advertise with us\\n    * Apps\\n    * Newsletters\\n    * Channel Finder\\n    * TV Schedule\\n    * Podcasts\\n    * Submit a Tip\\n\\n  * Our ChannelsShow more\\n\\n    * Al Jazeera Arabic\\n    * Al Jazeera English\\n    * Al Jazeera Investigative Unit\\n    * Al Jazeera Mubasher\\n    * Al Jazeera Documentary\\n    * Al Jazeera Balkans\\n    * AJ+\\n\\n  * Our NetworkShow more\\n\\n    * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\\n    * Al Jazeera Media Institute\\n    * Learn Arabic\\n    * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\\n    * Al Jazeera Forum\\n    * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\\n\\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\\n\\n  * facebook\\n  * twitter\\n  * youtube\\n  * instagram-colored-outline\\n  * rss\\n\\n© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/how-devastating-was-mondays-earthquake-in-japan', 'title': 'How devastating was Monday’s earthquake in Japan? | Earthquakes News | Al Jazeera', 'description': 'At least 30 people have been killed in Ishikawa while many people are believed to be trapped under rubble.', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

It was the strongest quake to occur in the\\nprefecture in more than a century. “It’s probably one of the largest\\nearthquakes on the west coast of Japan,” says Takuya Nishimura, an earthquake\\nscientist at Kyoto University in Japan.\\n\\nThe massive earthquake prompted tsunami warnings, with ocean waves reaching\\nmore than 1 metre high in some areas along the coastline. By the following\\nmorning, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) had recorded a further 146\\nsmaller earthquakes on Ishikawa’s Noto Peninsula, including one that the US\\nGeological Survey (USGS) measured at a magnitude of 6.2. The tremors have\\nresulted in more than 60 deaths, with reports of dozens more expected as\\nrescue teams search through the rubble.\\n\\n## What caused the earthquake?\\n\\nJapan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, because it\\nsits on top of four converging tectonic plates that constantly grind together.\\nSome 1,500 earthquakes strike the country every year, although the majority\\nare too mild to be felt. Most major earthquakes in Japan are caused by the\\nPacific Plate off the east coast, which slides beneath another plate. This\\nsubduction was the driving force behind Japan’s largest ever recorded\\nearthquake — a magnitude-9.1 quake that struck the Tohoku region in 2011 and\\ntriggered a massive tsunami — says Yoshihiro Hiramatsu, a seismologist at\\nKanazawa University in Japan.\\n\\nAI predicts how many earthquake aftershocks will strike — and their strength\\n\\nIshikawa itself is no stranger to earthquakes, with more than 500 occurring\\nsince 2020. In May 2023, the USGS measured a magnitude-6.3 earthquake that\\nshook the region and destroyed dozens of buildings. But these events are\\nunderpinned by a different mechanism from quakes that happen on the eastern\\nside of Japan, says Adam Pascale, a seismologist at the Seismology Research\\nCentre in Melbourne, Australia. Instead of occurring along the boundary of a\\ntectonic plate, the earthquakes in Ishikawa are triggered by faults within the\\nplate itself, which are put under pressure when the tectonic plates push\\nagainst each other. “That stress builds up in the plate and it’s going to slip\\nsomehow,” says Pascale.\\n\\n## Why have there been so many aftershocks?\\n\\nThe main magnitude-7.6 earthquake probably originated in a 150-kilometre-long\\nfault beneath the Noto Peninsula, says Aitaro Kato, a seismologist at the\\nUniversity of Tokyo. “The source area is very wide,” he says. This giant\\nfracture is of a type known as a reverse fault, which occurs when one slab of\\nrock moves on top of another. But he suspects that multiple fault ruptures\\ninside the plate probably triggered the aftershocks that followed the larger\\nearthquake.\\n\\nStudies have shown1 that fluids deep inside Earth’s crust could also drive\\nearthquakes in Ishikawa. As these fluids well up through the crust, they can\\nweaken the fault zone and cause it to slip, leading to a series of aftershocks\\nfollowing a main earthquake, says Hiramatsu.\\n\\n## How has the country responded?\\n\\nSince the 2011 Tohoku event, Japan has improved its earthquake early-warning\\nsystems, says Kato. Shortly after the magnitude-7.6 earthquake hit Ishikawa,\\nthe JMA issued a major tsunami warning and called on residents to evacuate to\\nhigher ground.\\n\\nBut the aftershocks have made it difficult for rescue teams to retrieve people\\nwho are trapped under the ruins of fallen buildings, and they could cause\\nfurther damage to already weakened structures, says Pascale. “That’s one of\\nthe biggest dangers at this point,” he says.\\n\\nThe frequency of aftershocks is expected to decrease in the coming days, but\\nmore will probably hit the region, says Nishimura. He adds that another\\nmagnitude-6 or 7 earthquake is not out of the question. “We need to prepare.”\\n\\n_Nature_ **625** , 228 (2024)\\n\\n_doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00010-1_\\n\\n### Updates & Corrections\\n\\n  * **Correction 04 January 2024** : This article has been amended to correct Aitaro Kato’s affiliation.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n  1.

The shaking and accompanying tsunami caused extensive damage on\\nthe Noto Peninsula, particularly in the towns of Wajima, Suzu and Anamizu. All\\nof the 220 fatalities and 26 missing individuals were reported in Ishikawa\\nwhile over 1,000 were injured across multiple prefectures, making it the\\ndeadliest earthquake in Japan since the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.[4]\\n\\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) officially named this earthquake the\\n**2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake** (Japanese: 令和6年能登半島地震, Hepburn: _Reiwa\\n6-nen Noto-hantō Jishin_).[5] It led to Japan\\'s first major tsunami warning\\nsince the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake,[6] and a tsunami of 6.58 m (22 ft) was\\nmeasured along the Sea of Japan coast.[7]\\n\\n## Tectonic setting[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Eastern margin of the Sea of Japan\\n\\nThe Noto Peninsula lies on the southeastern margin of the Sea of Japan, which\\nwas formed by back-arc rifting related to subduction of the Pacific Plate\\nbeneath the Eurasian Plate along the Japan Trench. This process began during\\nthe Early Miocene, ending in the Middle Miocene. By the late Pliocene the\\ntectonic regime changed to compression, probably associated with collision\\nbetween the Izu–Bonin Arc and Honshu.[8] This led to reactivation of the rift\\nfaults in reverse sense, combined with inversion of the basins formed by these\\nfaults.[9] Currently Japan is situated on the convergent boundaries between\\nthe Pacific, Philippine Sea, Okhotsk and Amurian Plates. Along the island\\narc\\'s east and southeast coasts, subduction of the Pacific and Philippine Sea\\nPlates occurs at the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough, respectively. The west\\ncoast of Honshu, bordering the Sea of Japan, is a north–south trending\\nconvergent boundary between the Amurian and Okhotsk Plates. It has been\\nproposed that it is an incipient subduction zone, consisting of eastward-\\ndipping thrust faults.[10]\\n\\nThe rifting and subsequent inversion has created a series of faults along the\\ncoast that have the potential to move and cause earthquakes, in the range of\\nMw 6.8–7.9, in many cases with tsunamis.[11] Major earthquakes and tsunamis\\nalong this boundary occurred in 1741, 1833, 1940, 1964, 1983 and 1993,\\nalthough the origin of the 1741 tsunami remains open to debate.[12] A fault\\nknown as the F43 (in the list of 60 faults evaluated) reaches the seabed just\\nnorth of the Noto peninsula trending WSW–ENE. This southeast-dipping fault,\\nwhich consists of two segments with a combined length of 94.2 km (58.5 mi),\\nhas been judged to be capable of producing an earthquake of Mw 7.6.[11]\\n\\nThe northeastern tip of the Noto Peninsula has been subject to an earthquake\\nswarm for the last three years, with the largest earthquake being a Mw 6.3\\nevent that took place in May 2023.[13] The earthquake was the strongest to hit\\nthe peninsula since records began in 1885.[14]\\n\\n## Earthquake[edit]\\n\\nUSGS ShakeMap\\n\\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a moment magnitude of 7.5\\nand a focal depth of 10 km (6.2 mi) for the earthquake. The Japan\\nMeteorological Agency recorded a magnitude of MJMA 7.6.[15][16] It was the\\nlargest earthquake to strike Ishikawa since at least 1885,[17] and the largest\\nto strike Mainland Japan since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.[18]\\n\\nThe focal mechanism of the mainshock corresponded to shallow reverse faulting\\nalong a northeast-trending plane dipping northwest or southeast,[3] happening\\nalong the convergent boundary between the Okhotsk Plate and Amurian Plate. A\\nmagnitude 5.5 foreshock struck four minutes before the mainshock,[19][20]\\nwhile a magnitude 6.2 aftershock struck nine minutes later.[21] More than\\n1,200 aftershocks were recorded across a 100 km (62 mi) zone.[22] At least\\nseven of them registered a magnitude of 5.0 and above.[7]\\n\\nUSGS generated Finite Fault Surface Projection\\n\\nAccording to a finite fault model released by the USGS, the earthquake rupture\\nextended over 160 km (99 mi) by 20 km (12 mi) from the southwestern Noto\\nPeninsula to Sado Island along a southeast-dipping fault. Slip was mostly\\nconcentrated entirely beneath the peninsula. The zones of the largest slip\\noccurred southwest of the hypocenter while little to no slip occurred in the\\nsea between the peninsula and island. The patch immediately southwest of the\\nepicenter produced the displacement of 5.992 m (20 ft) beneath the peninsula\\'s\\ncoast. Another zone of slip occurred further southwest beneath the same\\nstretch of coastline, producing up to 6.030 m (20 ft) of slip beneath\\nMotoichi. The fault likely ruptured towards the seafloor at the peninsula\\nwhile little to no slip was observed on the seafloor between the peninsula and\\nSado Island. The entire rupture process took about 50 seconds with the\\ngreatest phase of seismic moment release occurring some 25 seconds after\\ninitiation.[23]\\n\\n### Ground effects[edit]\\n\\nAbout 85 km (53 mi) of coastline spanning Suzu, Wajima and Shika was raised\\nand the shore moved seawards by up to 200 m (660 ft). Wajima\\'s Minazuki Bay\\nwas uplifted 4 m (13 ft) while at Nagahashimachi\\'s fishing port, a tide gauge\\nwas rendered unuseable because the seafloor was exposed.[24] The Geospatial\\nInformation Authority of Japan said parts of the country moved up to 1.3 m (4\\nft 3 in) westwards with the maximum displacement observed at Wajima due to\\ncrustal deformation. At Anamizu, land shifted 1 m (3 ft 3 in) westwards.\\nHowever, the agency said these movements could be slope or local ground\\nmovement instead.[25] The agency also added that crustal uplift of 4 m (13 ft)\\noccurred in western Wajima and 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) in northern Suzu.[26] Near\\nWajima\\'s port, the shoreline of a sandy beach was moved 250 m (820 ft)\\nseawards due to the coastal uplift.[27] The coastline in the Kawaura district\\nof Suzu was also found to have moved 175 m (574 ft) seawards due to the\\ncoastal uplift, while the land area expanded by a total of 2.4 square\\nkilometers. A port in the Ozawa district of Wajima was entirely drained.[28] A\\nseaward movement of 240 m (790 ft) was detected in the coasts of Monzenmachi\\nand Kuroshimamachi districts in Wajima, as well as an expansion of 4.4 square\\nkilometers in the Noto Peninsula. Areas in the northern part of the peninsula\\nwere also found to have risen while the southern sections, particularly in\\nAnamizu, had subsided.[29]\\n\\n### Intensity[edit]\\n\\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said it recorded a maximum seismic intensity\\nof 7 ( _Shindo 7_ ), the highest level on its seismic intensity scale,[30] the\\nfirst time that an earthquake of that intensity had been observed in the\\ncountry since 2018.[31][32] The maximum intensity was reported in Shika,\\nIshikawa Prefecture. Intensity 6+ was recorded in Nanao, Wajima, Suzu and\\nAnamizu. Intensity 6– was recorded in Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture and in\\nIshikawa\\'s Nakanoto and Noto.[32] The earthquake was also felt by residents in\\nTokyo and across the Kanto Region[7] and as far as Aomori Prefecture in the\\nnorthern tip of Honshu to Kyushu in the south of the country.[31] A peak\\nground acceleration of 2,826 _gal_ was observed in Shika, which was close to\\nthat recorded during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake which measured 2,934\\n_gal_.[33] Due to the ground beneath Wajima and Anamizu comprising soft\\nsediments, ground motions were amplified.[34]\\n\\nLocations with a

Public broadcaster NHK said tsunami waves of\\n5 m (16 ft) could be expected.[7] The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said\\ndangerous tsunami waves were possible within 300 km (190 mi) of the\\nepicenter.[65]\\n\\nThe evacuation orders covered 62,000 people,[66] with 1,000 evacuees finding\\nshelter at the Japan Air Self-Defense Force base in Wajima in Ishikawa\\nPrefecture.[67] The major tsunami warning was later downgraded to a tsunami\\nwarning at 20:30, about four hours after the earthquake.[68] These tsunami\\nwarnings were later downgraded to advisories,[69] which were eventually lifted\\nat 10:01 on 2 January, about 18 hours after the earthquake.[70]\\n\\nThe first waves were reported to have arrived at around 16:21,[7] although a\\nteam of researchers from Tohoku University\\'s International Research Institute\\nof Disaster Science said the first waves reached the Noto Peninsula within a\\nminute of the earthquake. In Suzu, the first waves were estimated to arrive\\none minute after the shock and two minutes later at Nanao. They also estimated\\nToyama was struck by the waves in about five minutes.[71] The quicker-than-\\nanticipated tsunami arrival meant people did not evacuate in time. Fumihiko\\nImamura, a member of the research team, said it may have been due to the close\\nproximity of the fault to the coast or a possible submarine landslide in\\nToyama Bay. Tsunamis in the Sea of Japan have been observed to arrive faster\\nthan those along Japan\\'s Pacific coast.[72] Tsunami modelling executed by the\\nUniversity of Tokyo and Building Research Institute of Japan computed the\\ntsunami to be 3.6 m (12 ft) in Suzu; 3 m (9.8 ft) in Noto; 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in)\\nin Shika and 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in Jōetsu, Niigata.[73]\\n\\nFlooding by the tsunami exceeded 4 m (13 ft) along the east and western part\\nof the peninsula. In Suzu, the highest waves exceeded 4.7 m (15 ft) at Misaka\\nTown, destroying homes and damaging the seawall. At Shika\\'s Kagami area, the\\ntsunami was recorded at 5.1 m (17 ft).[74] A run-up of about 4.2 m (14 ft) was\\nestimated at Shika based on the survey of warehouses and port facilities.[75]\\nAerial photographs of Suzu suggested a wave height of 3 m (9.8 ft) above sea\\nlevel;[76] subsequent analysis indicated a wave of 4.5 m (15 ft) at Nanba,\\nMisakimachi.[77] Tsunami waves exceeding 1.2 m (4 ft) struck Wajima,[78]\\nhowever data from the tide gauge was incomplete as it was one of several tide\\ngauges across the peninsula that stopped receiving information shortly\\nafter.[79] A tide gauge at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant recorded a rise of 3\\nm (9.8 ft) in tide level at between 17:45 and 18:00.[80] The plant\\'s operator\\nlater said that a 3 m (9.8 ft) wave reached the facility, which was built at\\nan elevation of 11 m (36 ft) above sea level and had a seawall measuring 4 m\\n(13 ft) high, at 17:45, without causing damage.[81]\\n\\nA tsunami measuring 90 cm (35 in) struck Kanazawa,[82] while a tsunami of 80\\ncm (31 in) struck Toyama Prefecture and Sakata, Yamagata Prefecture.[83] Waves\\nmeasuring 50 cm (20 in) were recorded in Nanao and Tsuruga[82] while waves\\nmeasuring 40 cm (16 in) were recorded at Kashiwazaki,[84] Tobishima, and Sado\\nIsland.[83] In Toyama city, a 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) wave was reported.[78] The\\ntsunami was recorded in Tottori Prefecture with heights of 0.6 m (2 ft 0 in)\\nin Sakaiminato and 0.2 m (7.9 in) in Iwami; in Toyooka, Hyogo Prefecture, it\\nreached 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in).[85] A 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in) tsunami was recorded at the\\nport area of Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture.[86] In Hokkaido, waves of up to 60 cm\\n(24 in) were reported in Setana, while 50 cm (20 in) waves struck Okushiri\\nIsland.[83]\\n\\nThe highest tsunami wave reached 6.58 m (21.6 ft) at a public park 600 m\\n(2,000 ft) from the Seki River mouth. The tsunami swept people away at the\\nentrance of a building and in the park. The locally high waves may be\\nattributed to the seafloor bathymetry concentrating the tsunami at a specific\\nlocation.[87] Video footage in Jōetsu, Niigata showed the tsunami approaching\\nthe rivermouth at 16:35, crashing into embankments and causing seawater to\\noverflow.[88] Evidence appeared to show that the tsunami reached at least 5.5\\nkm (3.4 mi) upstream from the river mouth.[89]\\n\\n### Damage[edit]\\n\\nIn Suzu, the tsunami was said to have arrived a minute following the\\nearthquake.[90] Homes were washed off their foundations and some were driven\\nfurther inland.[91] At least one person was killed by the tsunami.[92] The\\nearthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the town\\'s\\nbuildings.[93] The tsunami capsized many fishing vessels and carried some onto\\nland. Building collapses and overturned cars were observed from a news\\nhelicopter flyover of the city.[94] A resident recalled tsunami waves washing\\nover a road, picking up cars and debris; he also estimated the waves were 3 m\\n(9.8 ft) above tide level.[95] Ishikawa Prefecture\\'s governor, Hiroshi Hase,\\nsaid the tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to 100 m (330 ft)\\ninland.[96] A study conducted by Professor Shunichi Koshimura of Tohoku\\nUniversity found that the damage in Suzu was exacerbated by the seabed terrain\\nof Toyama Bay.[34]\\n\\nIn Shika, a series of tsunami waves reached the port at 17:40.[97] The tsunami\\nwhich had a 4.2 m (14 ft) run-up damaged the city\\'s fishing port and its\\nfacilities.[75] Tsunami observations in the peninsula was made difficult by\\nthe coastal uplift raising parts of the coast by up to 4.1 m (13 ft) and\\nextending the coastline further seawards.[98]\\n\\nIn the Shiromaru area of Noto, Ishikawa, homes were washed away and a fire was\\nstarted.[99] In Jōetsu, Niigata, the locally-high run-up exceeding 6 m (20 ft)\\nflooded 15 homes along the Seki River bank.[100] Beach houses and other\\nbuildings were also swept away.[101] Ten fishing vessels capsized in the Ogata\\nFishing Port area. Containers were also washed away and warehouses storing\\nmachinery were flooded.[102] The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport\\nand Tourism assessed that the tsunami inundated at least 100 ha (250 acres) of\\nland in Suzu and Noto.[103] At least 120 maritime vessels were reported to\\nhave been sunk or capsized from the tsunami, while at least 70 percent of\\nports in Ishikawa Prefecture sustained damage.[104]\\n\\n### Elsewhere along the Sea of Japan[edit]\\n\\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration warned that the coastlines of Gangwon\\nProvince and Pohang in South Korea could experience a rise in sea\\nlevels.[105][84] Waves of 0.3 m (1 ft) were anticipated along the nation\\'s\\neast coast from 18:29 to 19:17 local time.[106] A 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) tsunami\\nwas later reported to have occurred in Gangwon.[83][107] A 0.85 m (3 ft) high\\nwave reportedly struck Mukho at around 20:00 local time.[108] Tsunamis with\\nheights of 0.66 m (2 ft 2 in) were recorded in Uljin; 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) in\\nSokcho and 0.39 m (1 ft 3 in) in Gangneung.[109] It is thought to be the first\\ntsunami of over 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) observed in the country since 1993.[110]\\nAccording to Yonhap News Agency, citing North Korean state radio, a tsunami\\nwarning was issued with waves of 2.08 m (6 ft 10 in) potentially hitting the\\ncountry\\'s east coast.[107][111]\\n\\nWarnings for tsunami waves estimated to reach 1 m (3 ft) were also issued in\\nRussia, particularly along the west coast of Sakhalin Island,[112] where\\nevacuations were said to be conducted,[113] although Russia later said that no\\nevacuations were taking place there.[114] Tsunami warnings were also declared\\nin parts of Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsk Krai,[115] Vladivostok and\\nNakhodka.[116] The Emergencies Ministry of Russia said \"response teams are\\nready to deal with the possible consequences of a tsunami.\"[117] Officials in\\nVladivostok later said \"no tsunami was observed\" while in Nakhodka, \"the\\ntsunami passed almost unnoticed.\"[118] A 0.63 m (2 ft 1 in) wave was observed\\nat Preobrazhenie in Primorsky Krai;[119] at Kholmsk, it measured 0.18 m (7.1\\nin).[120]\\n\\n## Damage and effects[edit]\\n\\nSatelite image of Wajima taken after the earthquake, showing the area\\ndestroyed by the subsequent fires\\n\\nThe earthquake struck as Japan was marking New Year\\'s Day, a public holiday\\nwhen many were at home and most establishments were closed.[121] At least 220\\ndeaths occurred in Ishikawa Prefecture; 98 in Suzu, 88 in Wajima, 20 in\\nAnamizu, six in Noto, five in Nanao, two in Shika and one in Hakui.[122]\\nThirteen people died in the aftermath due to injuries or illnesses.[123]\\nAdditionally, one person was killed by the tsunami.[92] At least 1,009 people\\nwere severely injured in the prefecture,[124] and as of 12 January[update], 26\\npeople remained missing,[122] some of which may have been swept into the sea\\nby the tsunami.[125]\\n\\nBy 3 January, about 31,800 people were living in shelters following the\\nearthquake,[126] with about 27,700 sheltering in 336 evacuation centers in\\nIshikawa prefecture alone.[127]\\n\\nDamage was especially severe in Wajima, Suzu and Noto although their extent\\nwas unclear.[128] At least 780 people across 30 districts in remote vilages\\nwere isolated due to damaged roads and landslides and required helicopters to\\nbe reached.[129] Many of the collapsed houses in Wajima were traditional\\nwooden structures that were built prior to current building regulations that\\nwere imposed in 1981. Information from 2018 also revealed that more than half\\nof buildings in Wajima did not follow these regulations.[130] In Suzu, many\\nbuildings were built before the enactment of modern building codes in 1950,\\nwhile in 2019, only 51% of the town\\'s houses were deemed earthquake-resistant,\\ncompared with 87% for the entire country.[131]\\n\\nAt least 11,297 buildings across Ishikawa were damaged.[122] Many homes in\\nWajima, Suzu, and Noto were destroyed but the number remains unspecified.[132]\\nIn Wajima, at least 60 houses collapsed,[133][134] and ninety percent of the\\nfatalities there were attributed to falling debris from collapsed houses.[135]\\nA fire occurred in the city around 17:00. Due to damaged roads, firefighters\\nwere unable to extinguish the flames.[136] The fire consumed an estimated 200\\nbuildings, including many homes,[137][138] and the Asaichi morning market; a\\n1,000-year old shopping district and tourist attraction that hosted about 200\\nstalls.[139] An area of up to 48,000 square metres was affected by the fire,\\nwhich experts said was exacerbated by the loss of water supply and the tsunami\\nwarning, which prevented firefighters from responding immediately to the\\nblaze.[140] More than 30 people were injured in the city. In Suzu, up to 5,000\\nhouses[141] and 90 percent of the buildings were destroyed,[142][143]\\nincluding many due to fires.[144] The mayor of Suzu said about 4,000 to 5,000\\nhouseholds of the city\\'s 6,000 were no longer habitable, adding that damage\\nwas \"catastrophic\".[145]\\n\\nRescue dog and relief worker searching a collapsed house\\n\\nThe Ishikawa Nanao Police Station said collapsed homes trapped people before\\nthey were rescued.[146] A spokesperson at Wajima Municipal Hospital said\\npeople had broken bones or were injured by falling objects.[147] Seventeen\\nbuildings collapsed, 24 were partly destroyed and 19 were partially damaged in\\nShika.[128] In Anamizu, nine buildings were destroyed,[148] including three by\\na landslide which killed 16 people.[149] Across the mountainous region of the\\npeninsula, landslides were widespread.[91] The number of landslides was\\nestimated at 1,000.[150] At least nine landslide dams were discovered in the\\nWajima area on 9 January. These landslide dams had the potential to cause\\ndebris avalanches.[151]\\n\\nTwenty homes in Shiromaru, Noto, were destroyed by fire, while many others\\ncollapsed.[128] The tsunami also washed debris onto streets.[152] Operations\\nof the Noto Airport were suspended after five cracks as long as 10 m (33 ft)\\nappeared on the runway; the terminal of the airport also sustained\\ndamage.[153] Access roads leading to the airport were blocked, while about 500\\npassengers were left stranded inside the facility,[66] which was expected to\\nbe closed until 4 January. Access to the northern part of the Noto Peninsula\\nwas limited by a damaged road.[127] Noto Island was isolated after the bridge\\nlinking it to Nanao in Honshu was closed.[121] At least 902 houses in Uchinada\\nand 698 others in Kahoku were damaged.[92]\\n\\nIn Toyama Prefecture, 41 people were injured, three of them seriously.[154]\\nEight of the injuries occurred after the ceiling of a pachinko parlor\\ncollapsed in Toyama City.[155] Twenty-two houses collapsed, 20 others were\\nseverely damaged and 1,873 others were partially damaged, mostly in the cities\\nof Himi and Toyama.[154] In Niigata Prefecture, 48 people were injured, 11\\nbuildings collapsed or were badly affected and 4,955 others were partially\\ndamaged, including 3,930 in Niigata City;[156][157] 44 areas of Nishi Ward had\\nliquefaction reported.[132] One cardiac arrest case was reported in an elderly\\nperson in the prefecture, likely linked to the earthquake.[158] In Fukui\\nPrefecture, six people sustained minor injuries,[148] and 45 houses sustained\\nminor damage in Awara.[159] Two injuries were also reported each in Osaka[160]\\nand Hyōgo Prefectures,[161] while one person each was injured in Gifu and\\nNagano prefectures;[132] in Nagano, four houses were partially damaged.[162]\\n\\nCracked roads and broken water mains were reported in the cities of Himi and\\nOyabe, Toyama Prefecture.[163] Liquefaction occurred in Niigata city; sewer\\npipes also ruptured and many homes were left without water.[164] Thirty homes,\\nmostly in Nishi-ku, were damaged.[165] The Onohiyoshi Shrine in Kanazawa also\\nsustained damage. A landslide struck the main expressway between Toyama and\\nKanazawa, ripping apart several hundred meters of roadway.[166] Four houses\\nalong a hill fell over as the land under them collapsed in the eastern part of\\nKanazawa.[167] Sections of Japan National Route 8 was buried by landslides in\\nJōetsu, while track foundations caved in at the JR Echigo Line.[168] A bridge\\nalong the Kurobe Gorge Railway, a popular tourist line, was damaged due to\\nfalling rocks.[169] Cracks also appeared at the Nōetsu Expressway.[170]\\n\\nAround 260 convenience stores in the affected areas belonging to 7-11 and\\nFamily Mart were closed, while deliveries were delayed due to road\\nclosures.[121] Japan Post also suspended services to the Noto Peninsula until\\n12 January due to road closures.[171] NTT Docomo, Rakuten Mobile,[83] Softbank\\nand KDDI reported telecommunications and internet service disruptions in\\nIshikawa and Niigata prefectures,[172] while NTT West said its facilities were\\ndamaged by the earthquake. At Shika Nuclear Power Plant, an explosion occurred\\nnear the power transformer of the No. 2 reactor, while the transformer at the\\nNo. 1 reactor was rendered inoperable due to an oil spill.[83][173] The site\\'s\\n4 m (13 ft) high seawall was found to have tilted by around several\\ncentimeters following the earthquake.[174] At the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear\\nPower Plant in Niigata prefecture, water spilled from the fuel pools of two\\nreactors due to the force of the earthquake.[175]\\n\\nAt least 36,000 households and 19 medical facilities lost power following the\\nearthquake[84][121] and more than 110,000 households were left without\\nwater.[176] In Shika, water was being rationed daily at six litres per person\\nfollowing the earthquake.[177] By the morning of 3 January, the number of\\nhouseholds without power had dropped to approximately 33,900.[178]\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology reported\\nthat 276 educational facilities had been damaged by the earthquake,\\nparticularly in Niigata, Ishikawa, Toyama, Fukui and Shiga prefectures. It\\nalso said 39 schools in four prefectures had been converted to evacuation\\nshelters. The ministry also reported damage to 20 cultural sites in Toyama and\\nNiigata prefectures. Several stone lanterns collapsed at the Zuiryū-ji temple\\nin Takaoka, which is a designated National Treasure, while a slope collapsed\\nat the Sado mine.[179] About 350 people across evacuation centers were\\ninfected by COVID-19 or the common flu,[180] while at least 40 cases of\\ngastrointestinal illnesses such as norovirus were detected.[181] A 90 year old\\nwoman was rescued from a collapsed house after 124 hours in Suzu.[182]\\n\\n## Response[edit]\\n\\n### Government response[edit]\\n\\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the establishment of a special\\nemergency center to gather and disseminate information on the earthquake and\\ntsunami.[112] Defense minister Minoru Kihara ordered the Japan Self-Defense\\nForces (JSDF) to assist in rescue efforts.[183] He later announced the\\ndeployment of 2,000 JSDF personnel to the affected region,[184] with 8,500\\nothers on standby. About 20 JSDF aircraft were also dispatched to survey the\\ndamage.[185] An additional 2,000 firefighters and 1,000 police officers were\\nalso deployed to assist in rescue operations.[176][186] About 3,000 rescuers\\nwere sent to the Noto Peninsula alone.[187] By 4 January, at least 150 people\\nhad been rescued, while at least 2,000 of the 10,000 evacuees from Wajima had\\nreceived humanitarian aid.[130]\\n\\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida led the government response to the earthquake.\\n\\nThe Japanese government announced that it would allocate 4 billion yen ($28\\nmillion) from reserve funds to use in disaster relief efforts[188] and\\nincreased the number of JSDF personnel involved in the response to 6,300.\\nDefence Minister Kihara added that UH60JA helicopters were to be used in\\nrelief efforts, in their first major deployment since the 2023 Miyakojima\\nhelicopter crash in April.[189] The Japanese government also announced that\\nfamilies whose houses were completely destroyed or severely damaged would\\nreceive aid amounting to 3 million yen ($20,000).[190] Ishikawa, Niigata,\\nToyama and Fukui prefectures requested financial support for 47 municipalities\\nunder the Disaster Relief Act, under which the national government is expected\\nto cover 50 to 90 percent of expenses for disaster response and\\nrehabilitation. The Japanese health ministry also instructed hospitals to\\noffer health insurance coverage to patients affected by the quake, including\\nthose without insurance certificates[191] and opened a telephone interpreting\\nservice in 23 languages to help medical workers handle foreign patients in the\\naffected areas.[192] Authorities in Ishikawa prefecture also opened an email\\nhelp line to assist affected residents and tourists.[193]\\n\\nOn 4 January, the Japan Coast Guard began searching its coast with an aircraft\\nand patrol boat for people missing; presumably swept away by the tsunami.[125]\\nAt least one person was declared missing from the tsunami.[194] At least two\\npeople were rescued after the expiration of the 72-hour survival window in\\nWajima on 4 January. Large holes in roads and landslides made rescue efforts\\nchallenging four days after the earthquake.[195] Snowy weather conditions also\\naffected rescue efforts, with snowfall reaching 10 cm (3.9 in) in several\\nareas and raising concerns of additional building collapses.[196] Snowfall\\nsignificantly affected rescuers\\' ability to deliver supplies to isolated\\nvillages and recover survivors. Power was also cut due to snow, disabling cell\\nphones.[197]\\n\\nFollowing reports of deaths at evacuation centers, several vulnerable evacuees\\nwere evacuated to other prefectures, with at least 30 people being transferred\\nto medical facilities in Aichi Prefecture.[198] The government said it had\\nsecured about 6,500 public housing units for evacuees to resettle in across\\nthe country.[181]\\n\\n### Nuclear power plants[edit]\\n\\nKansai Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company and Hokuriku\\nElectric Power Company said they were inspecting their nuclear power plants\\nfor abnormalities.[7][199][172] Both the Kansai[106] and Hokuriku Electric\\nPower Companies initially said no abnormalities were reported,[200] with the\\nreactors at the latter\\'s Shika Nuclear Power Plant in Ishikawa Prefecture\\nhaving been closed for inspections at the time of the earthquake. However, it\\nwas later confirmed that there had been a cumulative oil spillage of 19,800\\nliters at two of the reactors, partially impacting the plant\\'s ability to\\nreceive power from external sources.[201][202]\\n\\nThe Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) also found no irregularities\\nin power plants along the Sea of Japan coastline,[134] but ordered Hokuriku\\nElectric Power Company to conduct further study of the earthquake\\'s impact on\\nthe Shika Nuclear Power Plant.[203] Hokuriku Electric Power Company also shut\\ndown two generators at its Nanao Ota thermal power plant in Nanao.[82]\\n\\n### Transport[edit]\\n\\nShinkansen services were suspended in central and eastern parts of Japan\\nfollowing the earthquake,[204] stranding at least 1,400 passengers aboard four\\nstalled trains between Toyama and Kanazawa for about 11 hours.[127][205][206]\\nLocal train services were also halted for up to 24 hours following the\\nearthquake, stranding about 1,000 passengers aboard express trains.[66]\\nShinkansen services resumed in the afternoon of 2 January.[207] Several major\\nhighways in the affected areas were also closed.[208] All Nippon Airways and\\nJapan Airlines cancelled flights to Toyama, Ishikawa, and Niigata prefectures\\nfor the rest of 1 January.[172] Japan Airlines subsequently announced\\nadditional flights to Komatsu Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture and Niigata\\nAirport on 2 January.[209]\\n\\nBy the morning of 3 January, Japan Railways partially resumed services,[210]\\nhowever, some local lines remained suspended, including the Nanao Line and the\\nNoto Railway.[170] The MLIT confirmed that Noto Airport would remain closed\\nuntil 4 January,[210] with the resumption of services expected to resume on 25\\nJanuary.[170]\\n\\n### Humanitarian aid[edit]\\n\\nJMSDF personnel in Maizuru loading relief supplies onto the JS Hiuchi bound\\nfor the Noto Peninsula\\n\\nDue to blocked roads, humanitarian aid was sent to the peninsula using ships,\\nwhile other isolated areas were accessed through helicopters.[211] In light of\\nthe difficulties in providing aid, Ishikawa Prefecture asked individuals to\\nrefrain from sending aid, instead limiting the call to corporations only.[212]\\nBy 4 January, authorities had delivered about 240,000 meals, 500 packages of\\npowdered milk, and 190,000 bottles of drinking water to the affected\\nareas.[213]\\n\\nOn the evening of 2 January, a collision occurred at Haneda Airport in Tokyo\\nbetween a Japan Coast Guard DHC-8 aircraft carrying humanitarian aid to\\nearthquake victims in Niigata and Japan Airlines Flight 516, an A350-900 from\\nNew Chitose Airport landing at Haneda, destroying both aircraft. All 379\\npeople aboard the JAL plane were evacuated; however, 15 sustained\\ninjuries.[214] The captain of the Coast Guard plane escaped with critical\\ninjuries, while the remaining five crew members were killed.[215][216][217]\\n\\nPrivate organizations raised at least $8 million in crowdfunding drives for\\nrelief aid, while the Ishikawa prefectural government began accepting cash\\ndonations at its offices, including those in Tokyo and Osaka, while announcing\\nplans to open a bank account for further donations.[218] Apparel companies,\\nincluding Gunze, Fast Retailing and Onward Holdings, donated at least 170,000\\nitems for victims of the earthquake.[219] About 110 hotels and inns\\nvolunteered to take in 3,000 people displaced by the earthquake.[220]\\n\\nThe Taiwanese government announced ¥60 million in aid to support rescue\\noperations and relief. A donation account was also created.[221] United States\\nAmbassador Rahm Emmanuel pledged an initial $100,000 in humanitarian aid to\\nJapan and logistical support from the United States military.[222] Japan said\\nit only had plans to accept aid from the United States despite offers from\\nother countries including Taiwan and China. In a statement from Chief Cabinet\\nSecretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the country was \"not accepting any personnel or\\nmaterial aid at the moment given the situation on the ground and the efforts\\nthat would be required to receive them.\"[223] South Korea also said that it\\nwould provide $3 million worth of humanitarian aid.[224]\\n\\nLos Angeles Dodgers baseball player Shohei Ohtani donated an undisclosed\\namount of aid to victims in the Noto peninsula.[225] The Dodgers subsequently\\nannounced that it would donate an additional $1 million towards earthquake\\nrelief.[226]\\n\\nJR Freight announced that it would carry humanitarian aid to the affected\\nareas for free.[227]\\n\\nThe construction of temporary housing began on 12 January with 115 home units\\nin Wajima and Suzu. Sixty units in Noto and Anamizu were also scheduled for\\nconstruction on 15 January.[228]\\n\\n## Aftermath[edit]\\n\\nThe aftermath of the earthquake included a major humanitarian impact in the\\nworst affected regions, as well as a national economic impact. Preliminary\\nfindings by Japanese financial services company Nomura Securities suggested\\nthe temporary stagnation of economic activity would push down nominal GDP by\\n23 to 50 billion yen. Nomura estimated that the most affected cities, such as\\nSuzu, Wajima and Nanao, will experience a temporary pause in economic\\nactivity. NHK added that losses are likely to increase, as the damage to\\nroads, housing and factories has not been considered in the research.[229]\\nHowever, it is estimated that the wider impact on supply chains may be less\\nthan those compared to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.[230] Tourism in the\\naffected areas suffered negatively, with 10,000 people cancelling their\\nbookings in Toyama Prefecture alone, leading to losses of about 140 million\\nyen ($970,000 dollars).[169]\\n\\nAs of 5 January, approximately 24,000 buildings remained without electricity\\nin Ishikawa prefecture, and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry\\n(METI), Ken Saitō, told reporters of the difficulty of estimating a clear\\ntimeframe for the recovery of power.[230] A whale shark at the Notojima\\nAquarium died nine days after the earthquake. Park officials said damaged\\nequipment may have deteriorated living conditions inside the tank and\\ncontributed to its death.[231]\\n\\n## Reactions[edit]\\n\\n### Domestic[edit]\\n\\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako\\'s annual New Year appearance and greetings\\nto the public on 2 January was cancelled due to the earthquake.[66] The\\nImperial Household Agency said it was the first time that the event was\\ncancelled due to a natural disaster. It also reported that the Imperial couple\\n\"wish that rescue operations and fire-fighting efforts in affected areas will\\nprogress as quickly as possible amid the severe cold weather.\"[232] Prime\\nMinister Kishida also postponed a ceremonial New Year visit to the Ise Shrine\\ndue to the earthquake.[175]\\n\\nA moment of silence was held for the victims of the earthquake on the first\\nday of trading of 2024 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.[233]\\n\\nToyota delayed the beginning of its domestic vehicle manufacturing operations\\nfor 2024, which had been due to begin on 8 January, until further notice,\\nciting earthquake damage to some of its suppliers.[234]\\n\\n### International[edit]\\n\\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister\\nFumio Kishida, his condolences and wished the Japanese people a fast recovery.\\nIt marked the first time Kim has sent his condolences after a natural\\ndisaster, and the first time he has sent a telegram to Kishida.[235] It was\\nalso the first time that North Korea had sent official condolences to Japan\\nsince 1995.[236] Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent condolences\\nand said Australia was ready to send any assistance to\\nJapan.[121][237][238][239][240][241][235] Philippine president Bongbong Marcos\\noffered to send assistance to Japan,[239] while the Armed Forces of the\\nPhilippines also offered to collaborate with the JSDF in its response to the\\nearthquake.[242][243] International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina\\nGeorgieva and Pope Francis also expressed their prayers to the victims of the\\nearthquake.[121][244] The United States announced preparations for military\\nlogistics, food and aid. United States Forces Japan it remained \"ready to\\nsupport our Japanese Allies during this difficult time.\"[245]\\n\\nIn China, a news anchor from Hainan Radio and Television was suspended after\\nstating on his Weibo account that the earthquake was retribution over the\\nJapanese government\\'s decision to discharge radioactive water from the\\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean which started in\\nSeptember 2023.[246][247]\\n\\n## Misinformation[edit]\\n\\nMisinformation about the earthquake spread on social media platforms such as\\nTwitter.[248][249] Users falsely linked a November 2023 video of an underwater\\nearthquake in Indonesia,[250] photos of the 2011 Tōhoku and 2016 Kumamoto\\nearthquakes[251] and a 2021 landslide following the earthquake.[249] At least\\none account, claiming to belong to a victim of the earthquake, was found to be\\nusing misinformation to seek donations online.[252] False claims were also\\nmade of the earthquake being man-made, with a video citing a previous nuclear\\nweapons test by North Korea.[248]\\n\\nFormer Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatayama incorrectly claimed the\\nearthquake caused a fire at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant and suggested that\\nimpacts of the earthquake had been deliberately downplayed to restart the\\nplant. While there had been a minimal oil spill at two of the reactors of the\\nplant, it was confirmed that there was no impact on the plant.[253]\\n\\n## See also[edit]\\n\\n  * Earth sciences portal\\n  * Japan portal\\n\\n  * List of earthquakes in 2024\\n  * List of earthquakes in Japan\\n  * List of tsunamis\\n  * 2007 Noto earthquake\\n\\n## References[edit]\\n\\n  1. **^** \"Notohantō jishin, hoken songai-gaku wa 64 oku-doru Amerika KCC ga shisan\" 能登半島地震、保険損害額は64億ドル 米ＫＣＣが試算 [Noto Peninsula Earthquake: $6.4 billion insured loss estimated by US KCC] (in Japanese).
